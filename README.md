# 🥗 Healthy Eating Dataset Analysis

This project presents a comprehensive Excel-based data analysis of **healthy eating patterns**, focusing on different types of meals and their nutritional values. The dataset explores how meal type, cuisine, and diet category influence calorie intake, macronutrients, and overall nutrient balance.

The goal of this analysis is to identify **healthiest meal options**, compare nutritional composition across diet types, and provide data-driven insights to support better dietary planning and health decision-making.
